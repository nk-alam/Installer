## Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- This app requires system-level permissions for APK installation
- APK signing is performed locally for demonstration purposes
- In production, consider server-side signing for enhanced security

### Limitations
- Some features require root access on newer Android versions
- Installation tracking may vary based on device manufacturer
- APK signing implementation is simplified for demonstration
